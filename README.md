Code is all written using NodeJS Express, Mongoose, and utilizes NoSQL using MongoDB.

Main developer: *Avi Glozman*

There's a bunch of credentials, URIs, and whatnot in this code. None of it works anymore as the resources referenced no longer exist. If you plan to use this code, just note that you should probably replace them.
